## Preface

In my place, if a product that doesn't have an official or general Chinese name, we often use the original name no matter what language it is in, so I may still call CharaChorder One, CharaChorder Two and Master Forge when I introduce the devices to others. But I think it would be interesting to give them a Chinese name on my own.

So in this article, I would explain both the English and Chinese names that I give to the product and my device.

## CharaChorder One and CharaChorder Two

For the translation to "CharaChorder", I choose 「流弦」.

[「流」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B5%81#Definitions) means fuild or flow, so it can be linked to the "Fuild Chord/Character Entry" feature of CharaChorder's devices, and it can mean that the thought is flowing inside this device. (Yes, type at the speed of thought!) The translation to the [Flow State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), 「心流」, also have this word.

「弦」 is taken from the translation to the "chord", 「和弦」, since the chording feature plays an important part in CharaChorder's devices.

For "One" and "Two", I choose the [financial form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals#Ordinary_numerals) of them, 「壹」 and 「貳」.

As a result, "CharaChorder One" and "CharaChorder Two" is translated to「流弦・壹」and「流弦・貳」by me. The dot between them is an [interpunct in Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#Chinese).

### Name of my CharaChorder One

My CC1 is named as "Estrea", which means the most shining star in the sky. This is also what I compare CC1 to. Estrea is also a word that appears in my favorite anime.

Its Chinese name is 「初星」. [「初」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%88%9D#Definitions) means the start or the first. [「星」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%98%9F#Definitions) means the star or the planet.

To me, this is the first special keyboard I've ever bought. It's like I were landing on a special planet for the first time. There are [some alien technologies](https://youtu.be/A6WvP191mrk?feature=shared) for typing and chording on that planet.

### Name of my CharaChorder Two

Though at the writing time, I haven't received my CC2, it is named as "Formula". It's yet another a word that appears in my favorite anime. I choose this name is because using 3D input devices to typing for me now is a standard way, like an proved scientific rule expressed in a formula.

Its Chinese name is [「方程」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%96%B9%E7%A8%8B), which is a direct translation of "Formula".

## Master Forge

For Master Forge, I translate it to 「匠鍛」. [「匠」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8C%A0#Definitions) can mean master, craftsman, artisan or workman. [「鍛」](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8D%9B#Definitions) can mean forge, temper or refine. Yes, it's a direct translation and already a powerful name in Chinese.

### Name of my Master Forge

Though at the writing time, I haven't received my M4G, its name has been decided to be "Exelion". Same as "Estrea", it's also a word that appears in my favorite anime. And it is also the name of a heavily-armed near-lightspeed craft in another anime. Continue the imagination above, I imagine that I were driving this powerful spaceship, Exelion, developed by the aliens on that planet, having a space trip to unknown spaces of digital world. [The one side of M4G](https://youtu.be/M3Xik3drspA?feature=shared&t=548) also look like a spaceship.

It's Chinese name is 「翔空」. It means flying in the sky. I think it's a good match with the name "Exelion".

## Bonus 1: Elvish Language (Font) for the Names

(P.S. Written date of this section: 2024/11/06)
The "Elvish Language"(精靈文) font is really popular now in my country. It makes Bopomofo symbols look like an Elvish language. You can try it at [this website](https://justfont.com/justforfun/elf-bpmf).

And here are the names above in "Elvish Language".

## Bonus 2: The Slogan

By the way, I would translate the slogan of CharaChorder, "Type at the speed of thought", to "隨想即打". It's literal meaning is "Type as you think".

[^semi_cursive_script]: This style of Chinese calligraphy is called ["semi-cursive script"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-cursive_script)(行書). It's a style between "cursive script"(草書) and "regular script"(楷書). The cursive script is the fastest to write but difficult to read, and regular script is the most common style used in modern text. If we compare the cursive script to steno machines and the regular script to normal keyboards, the semi-cursive script is like CharaChorder and Forge devices. That's why I choose this style.
