# Out of the Box (==Pre-Kickstarter Pre-Order==)

{% blockquote %}
   :information_source: The parts shown here are the contents of the Master Forge bundle of the ==PRE-KICKSTARTER PRE-ORDER==. If yours is Kickstarter or post-kickstarter order, your contents might be different from this.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote %}
   :information_source: This box doesn't include the Trackball Bolt-on. It will be shipped individually in the future.
{% endblockquote %}

Here are some photos taken during my unboxing.

A sticker is between the two layers of box.

After opening one more layer, I could see the tactical carrying case, deskmat, and other parts.

## Things outside the carrying case

- Cleat: used to collect some small parts

This is a closer look at the cleat. It has an allen key on it.

## Things inside the carrying case

Inside the carring case, there are the device and a V clip[^v_clip].

(The V clip and the device were in seperated state when I opened the box. They might or might not be seperated in your case.)

[^v_clip]: I don't know the official name of this part. The name "V clip" is from a comment in [this video](https://youtu.be/gdPakqb_Jdk?feature=shared).

# Connect

I use the provided USB-C to USB-A cable to connect my M4G to my computer. Please connect the left port on the M4G to the computer.

# Splitting the Digitizers

(Please don't split the digitizers when M4G is connecting to the computer.)

I used the provided allen key to unscrew the two black screws on the bridge between two digitizers.

I carefully plugged out the center black part (Electrical Bridge), and I could slide out the digitizers from the mechanical bridge.

Those parts can be put on the cleat to prevent them from missing.

After that, I used the provided USB-C to USB-C cable to connect the ==left port== of the right digitizer and the ==right port== of the left digitizer. Then I could connect it to my computer again and use it.
