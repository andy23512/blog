## Practice device layout

- Propose: Get familiar with the locations of each key until you don't need the visual guides
- Recommended WPM: 0~13
- Recommended tool:
  - Letters tier at [dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/)
  - Alphabetic tier at [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)
  - Number, letter, and symbol lessons at [Alnitak](https://andy23512.github.io/alnitak/)
- Recommended goal:
  - Reach 13 WPM at Letters tier at [dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/) or Alphabetic tier at [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)
  - Reach 100 Combos and 100 CPM at non-review lessons at [Alnitak](https://andy23512.github.io/alnitak/)

{% collapsecard "Explanations" %}Unlike standard keyboards, CharaChorder 3D input devices, including CharaChorder One, CharaChorder Two, and Master Forge, don't have key labels on them, so learning touch typing is crucial for better using them. Therefore, the first thing we need to get familiar with is the positions of each key.

The official training applications ([dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/) and [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)) have corresponding tiers for this. You can follow the visual guide and practice all the letters there.

Besides, [Alnitak](https://andy23512.github.io/alnitak/) is a tool specially designed for practicing device layout on CharaChorder 3D input devices. Character keys, including numbers, letters, and symbols, are split into small lessons so that users can focus on a small set of keys at a time. Moreover, the visual guide fades out when users reach 20 combos, and it reappears when there is a mistake. It helps users memorize the location and prevents them from simply following the guide.

## Practice letters in-depth

- Propose: Strengthen your muscle memory with the letters
- Recommended WPM: 13~30
- Recommended tool:
  - Guided Lessons at [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) 
    - P.S. It's recommended to set the target speed to 30. You can also start with a lower speed and gradually increase it until 30 according to your learning pace and progress.
- Recommended goal:
  - All the letters become green at [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)

{% collapsecard "Explanations" %}[Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) helps users learn touch typing. If you've learned the device layout above, you can use Keybr to strengthen the muscle memory of the letters further.

The default target speed is 35 WPM, but it might take users weeks to unlock the 7th letters and months to complete all the letters, so 30 is recommended here. If it's still too hard for you, you can start with a lower target speed and gradually increase it in your pace.

## Practice trigrams

- Propose: Practice common letter groupings
- Recommended WPM: 13~27
- Recommended tool:
  - Trigram tier at [dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/)
  - Amalgamate tier at [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)
- Recommended goal:
  - Reach 27 WPM

{% collapsecard "Explanations" %}The official training applications ([dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/) and [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)) have corresponding tiers for practicing common trigrams in English. Practicing these trigrams would help you type faster in general since many words include those trigrams.
{% endcollapsecard %}

## Practice words

- Propose: Practice common words
- Recommended WPM: 20~40
- Recommended tool:
  - Words tier at [dot i/o](https://www.iq-eq.io/#/)
  - Lexical tier at [CharaChorder LaunchPad](https://launchpad.charachorder.com/#/)
  - [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)
- Recommended goal:
  - Reach 40 WPM

{% collapsecard "Explanations" %}The official training applications (dot i/o and CharaChorder LaunchPad) have corresponding tiers for practicing common words in English.

[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) is a popular tool for short-time typing practices and typing speed tests.
{% endcollapsecard %}

## Use in real life

- Propose:
  - Get familiar with using the device in your use cases
  - Fine-tune the layout and settings of your device to fit your use cases
- Recommended WPM: 20~

{% collapsecard "Show Detail" %}Putting the CC 3D input devices in your real use case is essential. Try to do small pieces of things with them.

For example, you can write short articles, code small programs, or do anything else that involves keyboards. You might find some key locations or settings you want to change.
