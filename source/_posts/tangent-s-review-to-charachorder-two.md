### Preface

I switched from CC1 to CC2 two days ago (2024/12/28. I started writing this article on 2024/12/30). Though I had only used CC2 briefly, I could sense many improvements in this upgrade, so I decided to start writing a review for CC2.

I had written <a href="{% post_path tangent-s-review-to-charachorder-one %}">a review article for CC1</a> before. CC2 inherits all the points I wrote about CC1 in that article. Then, in this article, I will focus on the improvements or differences between CC2 and CC1.

### Extended USB-C Port

After I took out the CC2 from the travel case and saw the CC2 for the first time, the first thing that amazed me was the exposed USB-C port. On CC1, the USB-C port is deep inside the device, so I need to use an additional small USB-C extender to make it easier to be re-plugged. However, the USB-C port of CC2 is already extended so I don't need the additional extender anymore! It's a great improvement.

### Key Caps

I found that the metal key caps of CC1, especially the gray ones, are a bit cold in cold weather, though they get warmer after using them for a while. However, the ones on CC2 don't have this problem. It's good for me because I often have cold hands in winter times.

Moreover, the rubber rings add friction between the key caps and fingers. They make the key caps more controllable.

{% endblockquote %}

### Quietness

Though the sound of CC1 is already negligible during daytime, they are a bit loud when I use it in a quiet environment. In contrast, CC2 is really quiet even when using it in such an environment. Having less noise helps me focus better.

### Lighter Switches

On CC2, the switches are lighter, and it reduces the workload of my fingers. Especially, I feel that moving the mouse cursor get much easier. It's a huge improvement in ergonomics.

### Summary

CC2 has many great improvements over CC1. The extended USB-C port makes it easier to be re-plugged. The new keycaps are not cold when used in cold weather, and they are more controllable. Moreover, the quietness helps me focus better, while the lighter keys make it more ergonomic. It has become more perfect than the previous generation!
