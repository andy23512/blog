P.S. 1: The :no_entry_sign: in the chord output is the [KSC_00] action, which is used to eliminate the auto space.
P.S. 2: The latest backup file of my chords is at [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andy23512/setting-files/master/CharaChorder/chords.json).
P.S. 3: FSE = Full-stack engineer, CS = customer service
